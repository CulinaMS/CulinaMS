# 🛠️ Development Notes

CulinaMS was created with learning in mind. Blazor is fairly new to me and I want to learn how to use it. I want to go slow paced and try to make good decisions.

I think it's a good idea to collect resources used during development and dicisions taken. This could also help new developers to get into the project. We'll see how this document evoles.

## 🔗 Used Resources

- Nice onboarding tutorial to create blazor projects within VS Code: <https://dev.to/rineshpk/blazor-server-crud-app-using-visual-studio-code-2b2g>

## 📋 Project Decisions

All descissions taken are not final, feel free to discuss them in an issue 💡

- Primary Coding environment shall be VS Code
- Deployment shall be done using docker
